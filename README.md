# Time-Series-ARMA-Project
The project focuses on time series analysis of Microsoft (MSFT) stock price data. It includes downloading the price time series for 300 business days, computing moving averages, analyzing linear and log returns, and conducting time series analysis. The analysis involves the application of Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) models and tests for Gaussianity and stationarity.

## Parts of the Research Project

1. Time Series
2. Moving Averages
3. Time Series Analysis
4. ARMA models
5. Gaussianity and Stationarity Test

## Concepts Utilised in the Project 

- Auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation analysis.
- ARMA modeling for time series.
- Impact of different Moving average periods.
- Testing for Gaussianity and stationarity in time series data.

## Python Modules and Packages Used in the Project
- **statsmodels** for time series analysis and modeling.
- **sklearn.metrics** for calculating Mean Squared Error.
- **scipy.stats** for statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Jarque-Bera).
- **yfinance** for downloading stock price data.
- **datetime** for date manipulation.
- **matplotlib** for data visualization and formatting.
- **numpy** for mathematical operations.
